# Proactive Health Management with ML

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict diseases based on symptoms and provide personalized supplement recommendations.

## Usage

### Using Google Colab
1. Upload the `dataset.csv` file and `feynn_lab_p1.ipynb` notebook to your Google Colab workspace.
2. Open and run the `feynn_lab_p1.ipynb` notebook to train and test the machine learning model.

### Running Locally
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

2. source venv/bin/activate
 
3. Install required dependencies:
pip install Flask scikit-learn numpy pandas

4.Run the main script:
python main.py

5.Run the Flask app:
python app.py

The server will start on a port. You can access the model through the web interface.
